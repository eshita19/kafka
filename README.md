# Why Kafka?
 - It is a high throughput distributed mesaging system which provides decoupling of data streams and systems.

 - Distributed, resilient architecture and fault tolerant.
 - Horizontal scalibility(https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/horizontal-scalability):
   - Can scale to 100s brokers
   - Can scale to millions of messages per second.
 - High performance - latency less than 10ms - real time.
 
# Use Cases:
 - Messaging system
 - Activity tracking.
 - Gather data from different locations.
 - Stream processing.
 - De-coupling of system dependencies.
 - Integration with many big data technologies.
 - Example:
   - Netflix uses to apply recommendations in real time while you are watching TV shows.
   - Uber uses Kafka to gather taxi and trip data in real time to compute the forecast demand and compute surge pricing in real time.
   - Linkedin uses kafka to collect user interaction to make better connection recommendations in real time.
